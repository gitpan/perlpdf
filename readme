           Complete PERL Documentation in Adobe Acrobat Format
      Brought to you courtesy of Bill Middleton and Adobe Systems, Inc.


  This directory includes the file perlbook.pdf, which contains the
entire standard documentation suite for perl5.  All of the standard
perl modules which include embedded Pod documentation, as well as
the complete set of perl pods are included.

  Most of the hyperlinks which are available in the perl html documentation
can be accessed through this document.  It includes a standard Acrobat
bookmark for each pod, which can be expanded to view the headers and
main topics for each document within.

  To view this document, you must have one of the Adobe Acrobat (tm)
tools, Acrobat Exchange, or Acrobat Reader.  Acrobat Reader is available
for no charge from the Adobe Systems, Inc. web site:

	<A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/">Get it here!</A>

  If you own Acrobat Exchange, you can also use the enclosed Acrobat Catalog,
which will allow you search the entire document for items of interest.

  This document was created using several steps: 

	- run pod2ps against all default perl pod, and Core modules

	- Distill the PostScript file using Acrobat Distiller

	- Index the Acrobat file using Acrobat Catalog

  As the perl documents continue to develop, I'll try to keep this distribution
up to date.  If you are a perl extension author, and wish to make something
like this available for your work, please contact me, and I'll try to find
time to help.
